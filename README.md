Final Project





__Wooseok's Dashboard

The data is about student's lifestyle, GPA, Stress level.

The question that I wanted to answer was how the relationship between theses factors look like. Therefore, using several variable tabs and plots tried to visualize it.

Tabs are organized as; Data Overview, Trade Off plot, PCA Summary, GPA-Stress Heatmap, Stress Profile, Stress Predictor, GPA Distribution.

Filters are; Study Hours, Sleep Hours, Stress Level, Color in Trade Off plot.

- Data Overview : We can look at the data set overview. Changing the filters differ the data set showing.
- Trade Off plot : It shows how the relationship graph between Predicted Stress and Predicted GPA. By changing the filter scale or changing the Stress Level, Color will show different range or color of the graph.
- PCA Summary : It shows how the dataset is clustered. Right plot shows the instruction of the data which are the PC1, PC2 that explains the dataset well. We can see the group tendency among this axis. All the filters also change the graph.
- GPA Stress Heatmap is used to show the tendency between these factors and help the comprehension of the dataset.
- Stress Profile : This shows the each students' status between the 5 main factors.
- Stress Predictor : This shows depending on which model type, you input the values of study hours and sleep hours, predicts the stress level.
- GPA distribution : This tab shows different types of plots to see the stress level and GPA relationship.
