Final Project


Peter's Dashboard
This dashboard explores the trends, distributions, and comparisons of the leading causes of death in the United States using NCHS data. The main goal is to provide interactive visualizations to analyze mortality patterns across time, states, and causes.

Tabs and their functionalities:
- Data Overview: Displays the full dataset in a table. Users can filter and explore the raw data.
- Yearly Summary: Shows a bar chart of the top causes of death for a selected year. Users can select a specific year with a slider.
- Death Trends (Top 5 Causes): Shows line plots for the top 5 causes of death nationwide over time.
- Comparing Multiple Causes: Using a similar line plot to the previous tab, we can add and remove causes to accurately compare trends over time for specific causes.
- State Comparison: Takes the top ten states for each cause of deaths. User can pick a specific cause they want to look at and the graph will display the top ten states and its total.
- Rate Trends by Year: This graph allows the user to select the state and a cause of death, and the ui will give a graph with the age-adjusted death rates over time.




__Wooseok's Dashboard

The data is about student's lifestyle, GPA, Stress level.

The question that I wanted to answer was how the relationship between theses factors look like. Therefore, using several variable tabs and plots tried to visualize it.

Tabs are organized as; Data Overview, Trade Off plot, PCA Summary, GPA-Stress Heatmap, Stress Profile, Stress Predictor, GPA Distribution.

Filters are; Study Hours, Sleep Hours, Stress Level, Color in Trade Off plot.

- Data Overview : We can look at the data set overview. Changing the filters differ the data set showing.
- Trade Off plot : It shows how the relationship graph between Predicted Stress and Predicted GPA. By changing the filter scale or changing the Stress Level, Color will show different range or color of the graph.
- PCA Summary : It shows how the dataset is clustered. Right plot shows the instruction of the data which are the PC1, PC2 that explains the dataset well. We can see the group tendency among this axis. All the filters also change the graph.
- GPA Stress Heatmap is used to show the tendency between these factors and help the comprehension of the dataset.
- Stress Profile : This shows the each students' status between the 5 main factors.
- Stress Predictor : This shows depending on which model type, you input the values of study hours and sleep hours, predicts the stress level.
- GPA distribution : This tab shows different types of plots to see the stress level and GPA relationship.
